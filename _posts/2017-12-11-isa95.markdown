In summer 2014, after careful consideration, I decided to join an organization that was in the business of manufacturing. Earlier in the spring days of the same year, I had finished reading a novel called `The Phoenix Project`. I am not a fiction fan but this novel was kind of a memoire of a technology manager. It had reminded me of my own work experience working for technology companies in silicon valley.

I wrote a material planning and forecast system for them. It was really a fun project. It was developed in Foxbase to run on a networked SCO unix environment.

After I finished reading "The Pheonix project", I had decided to explore manufacturing domain as a possible career move. I would recommend you to read the book even if you are not in technology or software development. 

## ISA 95
After working few days at the new contract manufacturing organization, I needed a quick way to understand the manufacturing domain. I wanted to study a reference model or architecture. I came across ISA 95. It is a standard from International Society of Automation (ISA). I found it to be a very well thought out work. The standard is more than 10 years old. Given all the buzz about `Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)`, `Digital Transformation` and recent come back of AI and `Machine Learning` it is still applicable with all its full scope. 

Due to the success of ISA 95 standard, it has been adopted by ISO/IEC organizations and referred as IEC 62264 - Eneterprise control system integration. In coming days and month, I am planning to provide details on ISA 95 implmenetion.


## What is ISA 95/IEC 62264?

ISA 95 focuses on manufacturing operations and its integration with business or enterprise systems. It provides the vocabulary and models for designing, building and operating manufacturing facilities. It provides implementation neutral timeless models that can be used to understand existing or concieve new manufacturing environments. The models can be applied regardless of degree of automation or technology.

### 1. Hierarchy models

Hierarchy models helps to understand the interdependecies of manufacturing functions. These models help in aggregating and reporting information at appropriate levels.

### 1.1. Functional hierarchy model
Functional hierachy model presents the manufacturing and related business functions in a layered fashion from level 0 to leve 4. These levels provide clear separation of activities. 

| Level  | Activities |
|---------|------------|
| Level&nbsp;0 | The actual physical production process.|
| Level 1 | Sensing and manipulating the production process. Example includes IoT sensors, alarm systems.|
| Level 2 | Monitoring, supervisory and automated control of the production process. E.g. application and operator console for underlying equipment.|
| Level 3 | Workflow to produce the desired end product. Maintaining records and optimizing production process. E.g. MES system|
| Level 4 | All business functions from order processing, purchasing to inventory and production scheduling|

#### Level 3
> Level 3 forms the core of manufacturing operation management domain. Level 0, 1 and 2 represent a production cell or work units where production is carried out. 

### 1.2. Equipment role hierarchy model
Equipment role hiearchy model describe the logical grouping and hiearchies where equipment can be located. This model may be used to implement the "security scope" of enterprise entities.

#### Enterprise
> `Enterprise` is the top level logical organization that controls all manufacturing sites. An Enteprise determines what products will be manufactured and where they will be manufactured. 

#### Site
> A `Site` generally refers to physical or geographical location. It may represent a manufacturing facility a division or branch of an organization. An `Enterprise` may have one or more `Sites`.
 
#### Area
> An `Area` is a physical, geographical or a logical location within a `Site`. A site may contain one more areas. 

#### Work Centers
> `Work centers` are locations where manufacturing and related work is carried out. Work centers refer to "Production Lines" or "Storage Locations" where inventory is stored. Work centers may contain one or more `Work units`

#### Work Units
> `Work units` are the lowest level in equipment role hierarchy. They refer to work cells or storage units.

## Next
In the next post I will go over implmenting hierarichal model. I will also discuss `Business to Manufacturing Makrup Language` from MESA that has provided and XML implementation of ISA 95 models.
