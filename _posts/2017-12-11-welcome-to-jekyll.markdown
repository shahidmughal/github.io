Few years back I discovered ISA 95. In my quest of understanding manufacturng domain in a very short amount of time, I wanted to see a reference model or architecture. I came across ISA 95. It is an intenrational standard from International Society of Automation (ISA). I found it to be a very well thought out work. Though the standard is old and given all the buzz about digital transformation, IoT and recent come back of AI and machine learning, it is still applicable with all its glory. I will be discussing and providing details, how I am successfully using it for few years. In the mean time you can read some detail from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI/ISA-95)
